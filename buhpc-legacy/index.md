- MGHPCC, but we were really "green" in both senses of the word
- SC11 and 12
- underdog team and we still finished fourth!
- frathest back I could trace when we participated
- from the days of AMD-GF split and AbuDhabi core based opteron servers
- NV tesla K10s (cutting edge at the time and we still saw >100% perf jumps every generation)
- This team had stuff that was not even released yet!
- Placed second once!
- Silicon Mechanics donated a large cluster to the team
